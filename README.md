BBTS: Blockchain Benchmark Test Set
====

## Introduction

BBTS aims to benchmark a pragmatic performance of blockchain architectures.

## Focus

### Test Set only

BBTS does not provides benchmark framework, but provides only test set.
BBTS is consisted with smart contract and sequential data.
When a benchmark tool does not provides feature which can test with our data sequentially, BBTS may provide plug-in for the benchmark tool.
